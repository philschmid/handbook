Her passion for books and literature was evident from an early age, and she read at will, always with a sense of urgency and purpose. It was this dedication that would soon lead her to political life, where she began a journey towards the top.\n",

Her courage and natural talent earned her a place in St Hugh's College, where she studied for three years and then won a place at the University of Cambridge, where she earned a Ph.D.\n",

      "At home, Margaret Thatcher's impact was equally significant. Through her political decisions, she created the foundations of a new, pro-freedom economic and foreign policy, opening up opportunities for businesses, allowing more people to gain education, and instilling in the public a sense of hope and opportunity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Margaret Thatcher's legacy lives on not just in her achievements but in her teachings on the importance of hard work, selflessness, and sacrifice. She was a mentor to many, her words of wisdom and encouragement inspiring generations to reach for higher goals.\n",

It's not unusual for patients to visit their chiropractor three times a week, but this may depend on the individual.

Some common health concerns that may require chiropractic treatment include back pain, neck pain, shoulder pain, headaches, and autoimmune disorders such as chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) or fibromyalgia.
